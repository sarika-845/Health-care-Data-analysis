🏥 Healthcare Data Analysis Dashboard (EDA)

This project focuses on performing ""Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) ""on a healthcare dataset to uncover meaningful insights related to patient demographics and medical conditions.  
An interactive Streamlit dashboard is built to visualize trends and relationships in the data.

---

##  Project Objectives
- Clean and preprocess healthcare data
- Analyze patient health indicators
- Visualize relationships between medical variables
- Build an interactive dashboard for data exploration

---

## Features
## 📊 Data Quality & Assumptions

- Approximately "15% of the dataset contains unknown or missing values" in certain columns.
- These values were intentionally retained as "Unknown" instead of being removed or imputed.
- This decision was made to preserve data integrity and avoid introducing false or misleading information.
- Retaining unknown values helps reflect real-world healthcare data, where incomplete or unrecorded information is common.
- All analyses and visualizations account for the presence of these unknown values.


### ✔ Univariate Analysis
- Age distribution
- Medical condition frequency analysis

### ✔ Bivariate Analysis
- Age vs Blood Pressure (scatter plot with regression line)
- Average Age by Medical Condition(bar chart)
- Gender vs Medical Condition (crosstab & heatmap)

### ✔ Interactive Dashboard
- Built using Streamlit
- Displays data tables and visual insights dynamically
